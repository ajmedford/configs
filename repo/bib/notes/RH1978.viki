* Polynomial Algorithms for deterministic Pushdown Automata

This paper shows ho to eliminate diverging $\varepsilon$-cycles in
DPDA's in polynomial time.

It shows that the problems $DPDA \subseteq FSA$ and vice versa are in P.
It follows that also $L(M) = L(F)$ for DPDA M and FSA F is in COM:P
and thus also emptiness testing for DPDA.
